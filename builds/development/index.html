    <h2>Things I Like</h2>
      <p>Hi there. I am a front-end developer and a translator. Working as a translator for 5 years, I had chance to get to know many industries including web technologies. First I had a little research about it to satisfy my curiosity, next thing I know I decided to become a web developer. Since then I've been studying intensively while doing freelance projects.</p>
    <h4>Here are few things I do other than coding and translating:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Making electronic music</li>
      <li>Playing the guitar</li>
      <li>Juggling</li>
      <li>Drawing</li>
      <li>Doing yoga</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>What I've Done So Far</h2>
    <p>I always apply what I learn to the next project. I often get lost in blogs and nice websites' source codes trying to improve my style and discover new ideas. In all of my projects I give a special care to organization and planning. Here you can see what I've done so far:</p>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Reflections on the Bay</h3>
        <img src="#" alt="reflectionsonthebay.com">
        <p>Customer needed a website which they can customize all they want. They already had an idea about what they want on their webiste and how it should be presented. I used Bootstrap framework to create this nice and simple single-page design.</p>

      <h3>My Portfolio</h3>
        <img src="#" alt="devin-watson.com">
        <p>I designed my portfolio with few different options in Adobe Illustrator CC 2015. I especially focused on responsiveness of the website. I used technologies including Git, SASS, Gulp which allowed me to be very organized and effective.</p>

      <h3>Pipe Clay Cottage</h3>
        <img src="#" alt="pipeclaycottage.com">
        <p>In this project, customer wasn't really sure what they wanted and the timeline was short. Therefore I customized a template they liked using HTML, CSS, XML and Google Maps API.</p>
